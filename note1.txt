minting- this is well note term for adding more coins or printing mre money to be simple
signing-it is popular mechanism in cryptography, use secp256k1 for generting key pairs
We are using a package called elliptic, note that elliptic also supports Curve25519 and other algorithms.
validations:-
this chain is valid when all blocks have valid transactions, transactiosn are valid only when:-
1. from,to, amount are not empty
2. senders address ahs more money than amount address
3. signature matches with data of transaction


ganache is a personal blockchain stimulator, local blockchain that we can run on our system
here in ganache fake ethers are provided by which we can run,deploy and testify our decentralozed application

truffle uses ganache for deployment
ganache is used for setting personal blockchain for testing solidity contracts

genache is used for deploying testing develop dapps
truffle provides environemnt for devolping dapps
if we want to integrate smart contratcs with truffle its very difficult with remix but easy with truffle
